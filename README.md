# Overview
This is a simple c2 developed using https://shogunlab.gitbook.io/building-c2-implants-in-cpp-a-primer
as a starting point but in Go. This is for exploration and understanding of how C2s work
at a deeper level, as well as for practicing my Go development. This is an alpha repo every iteration is likely to be a breaking release.
There is no goal to make this a fully functional c2 or red team framework.
